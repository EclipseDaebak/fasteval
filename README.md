# fasteval
A fast algebraic expression evaluation library.

`fasteval` is a library for parsing, compiling, and evaluating algebraic expressions.
It can be used directly as a calculator language (much like `python`), and it is
an excellent foundation for building higher-level-languages.

Documentation:

* [API Reference (docs.rs)](https://docs.rs/fasteval/)


## Usage

Add this to your Cargo.toml:

    [dependencies]
    fasteval = "0.1.8"


You should **always** build with `RUSTFLAGS="--emit=asm"` because it greatly improves LLVM's compile-time optimizations.

You can build with `--no-default-features` to disable alphabetical keywords like `and`, `or`, `NaN`, `inf`.  (These words might be important to your applications.)

You can build with `--features unsafe-vars` to enable [Unsafe Variables](https://docs.rs/fasteval/#unsafe-variables).


## Features
* Supports interpretation (i.e. parse & eval) as well as compiled execution (i.e. parse, compile, eval).
* Variables and Custom Functions.
* Safe for execution of untrusted expressions.
* Good base for building higher-level languages.
* Many built-in functions and constants.
* Supports all the standard algebraic unary and binary operators (+ - * / ^ %),
  as well as comparisons (< <= == != >= >) and logical operators (&& ||) with
  short-circuit support.
* Easy integration into many different types of applications, including scoped evaluation.
* Very fast performance.


## Easy Example

Here is one simple example.  See the [API Reference](https://docs.rs/fasteval/#examples) for many more!

The `ez_eval()` function performs the entire allocation-parse-eval process
for you.  It is slightly inefficient because it always allocates a
fresh `Slab`, but it is very simple to use:

```rust
fn main() -> Result<(), fasteval::Error> {
    // This example doesn't use any variables, so just use an EmptyNamespace:
    let mut ns = fasteval::EmptyNamespace;

    let val = fasteval::ez_eval(
        "1+2*3/4^5%6 + log(100K) + log(e(),100) + [3*(3-3)/3] + (2<3) && 1.23",    &mut ns)?;
    //    |            |      |    |   |          |               |   |
    //    |            |      |    |   |          |               |   boolean logic with short-circuit support
    //    |            |      |    |   |          |               comparisons
    //    |            |      |    |   |          square-brackets act like parenthesis
    //    |            |      |    |   built-in constants: e(), pi()
    //    |            |      |    'log' can take an optional first 'base' argument, defaults to 10
    //    |            |      numeric literal with suffix: n, Âµ, m, K, M, G, T
    //    |            many built-in functions: print, int, ceil, floor, abs, sign, log, round, min, max, sin, asin, ...
    //    standard binary operators

    assert_eq!(val, 1.23);

    Ok(())
}
```


## Performance Benchmarks

Here is a short summary of the performance benchmarks.  For a more complete report and anlysis, see the [API Reference](https://docs.rs/fasteval/#performance-benchmarks).

### Charts
Note that the following charts use logarithmic scales.  Therefore, tiny
visual differences actually represent very significant performance
differences.

**Performance of evaluation of a compiled expression:**

**Performance of one-time interpretation (parse and eval):**  
![Interpretation Performance](http://hk.likebike.com/code/fasteval/benches/fasteval-interp-20191225.png)

**Performance of compiled Unsafe Variables, compared to the tinyexpr C library (the
only other library in our test set that supports this mode):**  
![Unsafe Compiled Eval Performance](http://hk.likebike.com/code/fasteval/benches/fasteval-compiled-unsafe-20191225.png)

**Performance of interpreted Unsafe Variables, compared to the tinyexpr C library (the
only other library in our test set that supports this mode):**  
![Unsafe Interpretation Performance](http://hk.likebike.com/code/fasteval/benches/fasteval-interp-unsafe-20191225.png)

### Summary

The impressive thing about these results is that `fasteval` consistently
achieves the fastest times across every benchmark and in every mode of
operation (interpreted, compiled, and unsafe).  It's easy to create a
design to claim the #1 spot in any one of these metrics by sacrificing
performance in another, but it is difficult to create a design that can be
#1 across-the-board.

Because of the broad and robust performance advantages, `fasteval` is very
likely to be an excellent choice for your dynamic evaluation needs.
